If you're reading this at midnight, staring at a score report that says 194 and feeling like you just wasted months of your life — take a breath. I want to talk to you honestly about what just happened and what to do next.

You didn't waste anything. And you're closer than you think.

## Failing the RBT Exam Is Common — Really Common

Here's something most study programs won't tell you upfront: **a significant percentage of people don't pass the RBT exam on their first attempt.** You're not in some small, embarrassing minority. You're in much larger company than you think.

That doesn't make it feel better right now. I know. But it matters, because the story you're telling yourself — that you're not smart enough, that you're not cut out for this field — is wrong. The RBT exam is genuinely difficult. It tests applied knowledge across domains that many training programs only cover at a surface level. Failing it doesn't say something about you. It says something about the gap between how you prepared and what the exam actually asks.

That gap is fixable.

## What Your Score Actually Tells You

A scaled score of 200 is passing. If you scored in the 190s, you are not far off — and that distinction matters more than you might realize.

Your score report isn't just a number. The BACB breaks your performance into content areas, and each one gets a rating. **This is the most valuable document you have right now.** It tells you exactly where you lost points and exactly where to focus.

Most people who score close to passing have one or two content areas dragging them down while performing adequately in the rest. That's a very different problem than "I don't know the material." It means your preparation was uneven — strong in some places, thin in others.

That's specific. Specific problems have specific solutions.

## Your 4-Week Retake Plan

You're eligible to retake the exam after 30 days. Here's how to use that time.

### Week 1: Diagnose Before You Study

Do not open a textbook yet. Start with your score report.

- **Identify your weakest two content areas.** The BACB task list covers domains like measurement, assessment, skill acquisition, behavior reduction, documentation, and professional conduct. Your score report tells you where you underperformed.
- **Map those domains to the RBT Task List.** Pull up the current task list from the BACB website and highlight every task within your weak areas.
- **Be honest about what you didn't understand vs. what you just didn't review.** These require different strategies. Gaps in understanding need study. Gaps in exposure need practice.

### Week 2: Targeted Deep Study

Now study — but only your weakest areas.

- **Focus on your two weakest domains.** Resist the urge to re-study everything from scratch. You passed the other sections (or came close). Spreading your time evenly is the mistake that leads to the same result.
- **Use active recall, not passive review.** Don't re-read notes or re-watch videos. Instead, quiz yourself. Write out definitions from memory. Explain concepts out loud as if teaching a new RBT.
- **Connect concepts to your actual clinical experience.** If you're working as an RBT, you're already doing this material every day. The exam tests whether you can identify the correct terminology and principles behind what you're practicing. Think about real sessions — what procedures are you running? What measurement systems are you using? Tie the content to your lived experience.

### Week 3: Mixed Practice and Mock Exams

This is where most retake candidates skip ahead too early or skip entirely.

- **Take at least two full-length timed practice exams.** Simulate real testing conditions: timed, no notes, no breaks beyond what the real exam allows. The RBT exam is 85 questions in 90 minutes. Pacing matters.
- **After each practice exam, review every wrong answer.** Don't just check your score. For each question you missed, identify *why* — was it a content gap, a trick in the wording, or a careless error? Each type needs a different fix.
- **Mix domains together.** The real exam doesn't group questions by topic. Practice switching between content areas so your brain gets used to the context-switching.

### Week 4: Light Review and Rest

- **Review your notes from Weeks 1–3.** Focus on the specific concepts that kept tripping you up.
- **Do not cram the night before.** This is not an exam you can brute-force with last-minute memorization. By this point, you either know it or you don't — and if you followed Weeks 1–3, you know it.
- **Sleep. Eat. Show up calm.** Test anxiety causes more wrong answers than content gaps. The best thing you can do in the last 48 hours is rest.

## The Domains That Trip People Up Most

Based on what I see working with RBTs and RBT candidates, these are the three areas that cause the most retake failures:

**Measurement and Assessment.** Frequency, duration, latency, IRT, partial vs. whole interval, momentary time sampling — if these terms blur together for you, you're not alone. This domain requires precise definitions and the ability to choose the correct measurement system for a given scenario. Flashcards and scenario-based practice questions are your best tools here.

**Skill Acquisition.** Discrete trial teaching, naturalistic teaching, prompting hierarchies, prompt fading, shaping, chaining — the exam tests your ability to identify these procedures and distinguish between them in applied scenarios. Don't just memorize definitions. Practice identifying which procedure is being described in a short vignette.

**Professional Conduct and Scope of Practice.** Many candidates underestimate this domain because it feels like "common sense." It's not. The exam tests specific ethical guidelines from the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts, and the correct answer is often the one that feels overly cautious. When in doubt, the answer is usually: document it, tell your supervisor, and stay in your lane.

## One More Thing

Failing the RBT exam doesn't define your career. Some of the best RBTs I've worked with didn't pass on their first attempt. What separated them wasn't raw ability — it was willingness to look at their score report honestly, target their weak spots, and try again with a better plan.

You have the plan now. Use it.

If you want structured, domain-specific practice questions to help you target your weak areas during Weeks 2 and 3, I built [RBT Study at Behavior School](https://rbtstudy.behaviorschool.com) for exactly that purpose — timed quizzes organized by task list domain so you can drill down on what your score report is telling you.

You've got this. See you on the other side.
