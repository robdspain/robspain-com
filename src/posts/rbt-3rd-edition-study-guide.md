If you're studying for the RBT exam in 2026, there's something you need to know before you open another flashcard deck: **the exam changed.** On January 1, 2026, the BACB officially switched the RBT exam to the 3rd Edition Test Content Outline (TCO). That means any study guide, practice test, or flashcard set built for the 2nd Edition is now misaligned with what you'll actually see on test day.

This isn't a minor update. The 3rd Edition introduces 8 new tasks, expands ethics into an explicitly tested domain for the first time, adds token economies as a standalone competency, and requires cultural awareness across your practice. If you're using old materials without understanding what changed, you're studying for an exam that no longer exists.

Here's the complete breakdown — domain by domain, task by task.

## The 3rd Edition TCO at a Glance

The RBT 3rd Edition exam covers **6 domains**, **43 tasks**, and **75 questions**. Here's how the weight is distributed:

| Domain | Weight | Tasks |
|--------|--------|-------|
| A. Measurement and Data Collection | 15% | 7 |
| B. Assessment | 10% | 5 |
| C. Behavior Acquisition | 25% | 10 |
| D. Behavior Reduction | 20% | 8 |
| E. Documentation and Reporting | 15% | 6 |
| F. Professional Conduct and Ethics | 15% | 7 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **43** |

The single most important number on this table: **Behavior Acquisition at 25%.** One in four questions on your exam will come from this domain. If you're going to over-prepare anywhere, it should be here.

## Domain-by-Domain Breakdown

### Domain A: Measurement and Data Collection (15% · 7 Tasks)

**What it covers:** This domain tests your ability to collect, record, and graph behavioral data accurately. You need to know the difference between continuous and discontinuous measurement systems, understand how to implement each one, and demonstrate that you can record data reliably during sessions.

**What changed from 2nd Edition:** The 3rd Edition places greater emphasis on data integrity and interobserver agreement (IOA) procedures. You're now expected to understand not just *how* to collect data, but how to verify that your data collection is accurate and consistent with another observer. IOA is now a standalone testable task.

**Study tips:**

- Practice identifying which measurement system fits a given scenario. The exam will describe a behavior and ask you to choose between frequency, duration, latency, IRT, partial interval, whole interval, and momentary time sampling. Know when each one is appropriate — not just what each one means.
- Study IOA procedures until you can explain them to someone else. If you can calculate a simple agreement percentage and describe why IOA matters, you're in good shape.
- Graph by hand. Even if your clinic uses electronic data collection, practice creating simple line graphs with labeled axes. The exam may ask you to interpret graphed data or identify errors in a graph.

### Domain B: Assessment (10% · 5 Tasks)

**What it covers:** Assessment focuses on your role in the assessment process — conducting preference assessments, assisting with functional behavior assessments, and describing behavior in observable and measurable terms. This domain tests whether you can participate meaningfully in the assessment process under the supervision of a BCBA.

**What changed from 2nd Edition:** The 3rd Edition clarifies the RBT's role in indirect and direct assessment procedures. There's more specificity around how RBTs contribute to functional analysis conditions and what you're expected to observe and report during assessment activities.

**Study tips:**

- Know the types of preference assessments cold: free operant, single stimulus, paired stimulus (also called forced-choice), and multiple stimulus with and without replacement (MSWO and MS). Be able to identify which type is being described in a scenario.
- Understand the basic conditions of a functional analysis (alone, attention, demand, tangible, control/play) and what each condition is designed to test. You won't be designing FAs, but you need to know what's happening and why.
- Practice writing operational definitions. If the exam gives you a vague description like "the client is aggressive," you should be able to identify what's missing and what an observable, measurable definition would look like.

### Domain C: Behavior Acquisition (25% · 10 Tasks)

**What it covers:** This is the largest domain on the exam, and for good reason — it covers the core of what RBTs do every day. Discrete trial teaching, naturalistic teaching, prompting and prompt fading, shaping, chaining, **token economies**, and generalization procedures all live here. You need to understand how to teach new skills and how to systematically fade your support so the learner can perform independently.

**What changed from 2nd Edition:** Two major changes. First, **token economies are now explicitly included as a testable task** in this domain. While token systems were always part of RBT practice, the 3rd Edition makes them a standalone competency for the first time. Second, the domain now includes expanded content on generalization and maintenance — you're expected to understand how to program for skill transfer across settings, people, and materials.

**Study tips:**

- This domain is 25% of your exam. Allocate your study time accordingly — roughly one quarter of your total preparation should focus here.
- Master the prompting hierarchy: full physical, partial physical, model, gestural, verbal, visual, positional. Know how to implement least-to-most and most-to-least prompting, and understand when each approach is appropriate. Be able to identify prompt dependency and describe how to fade prompts systematically.
- Study token economies specifically. Know the components (tokens, backup reinforcers, exchange schedule), how to implement them, and common errors that reduce their effectiveness. This is new testable content — expect at least one question on it.

### Domain D: Behavior Reduction (20% · 8 Tasks)

**What it covers:** This domain covers procedures for reducing challenging behavior, including antecedent interventions, differential reinforcement, extinction, and function-based interventions. You need to understand the relationship between the function of a behavior and the appropriate intervention strategy.

**What changed from 2nd Edition:** The 3rd Edition strengthens the connection between assessment results and behavior reduction procedures. There's increased emphasis on function-based interventions and the expectation that RBTs can articulate *why* a particular intervention matches a particular function. The edition also expands coverage of antecedent-based interventions, reflecting the field's ongoing shift toward proactive rather than reactive approaches.

**Study tips:**

- Know the four functions of behavior (attention, escape, access to tangibles, automatic/sensory) and be able to match each function to appropriate interventions. This is the most common question type in this domain.
- Study differential reinforcement procedures: DRA, DRI, DRO, DRL, and DRH. Know the definitions, be able to identify which type is being described in a scenario, and understand when each is most appropriate.
- Understand extinction and its side effects (extinction burst, spontaneous recovery, emotional responding). The exam often tests whether you can identify an extinction burst vs. a worsening of behavior for other reasons.

### Domain E: Documentation and Reporting (15% · 6 Tasks)

**What it covers:** This domain tests your ability to document sessions accurately, maintain records, and communicate with supervisors and team members. It includes writing session notes, reporting critical incidents, and following data storage and confidentiality requirements.

**What changed from 2nd Edition:** The 3rd Edition adds explicit requirements around **mandatory reporting** and **documentation of supervision activities**. You're now expected to understand your legal and ethical obligations to report suspected abuse or neglect, and to properly document supervision sessions and supervisory feedback you receive.

**Study tips:**

- Review what constitutes a complete and accurate session note. The exam will present scenarios where documentation is missing key elements and ask you to identify what's wrong or what needs to be added.
- Study HIPAA basics as they apply to RBT practice. Know what constitutes protected health information (PHI) and the basic rules around storing, sharing, and disposing of client data.
- Understand the RBT's mandatory reporting obligations. Know who you report to, when you're required to report, and what triggers a mandatory report. This is both an ethical and legal requirement that the 3rd Edition now tests directly.

### Domain F: Professional Conduct and Ethics (15% · 7 Tasks)

**What it covers:** This is the domain with the most significant structural change in the 3rd Edition. Ethics is now **explicitly task-tested for the first time**, covering professional boundaries, scope of practice, supervision requirements, **cultural awareness**, and the RBT Ethics Code. Previously, ethical content was distributed across other domains without its own dedicated task items. Now it stands on its own with 7 dedicated tasks and 15% of the exam.

**What changed from 2nd Edition:** This is the most restructured domain on the exam. Three changes deserve special attention:

1. **Cultural awareness is now a required competency.** You're expected to understand how culture affects behavior, assessment, and service delivery, and to demonstrate cultural humility in your practice. This was not a standalone task in the 2nd Edition.
2. **Scope of practice boundaries are tested more explicitly.** The exam will present scenarios where an RBT is asked to do something outside their scope and expect you to identify the correct response — which almost always involves deferring to your supervising BCBA.
3. **The supervision relationship has new dedicated tasks.** You need to understand your responsibilities as a supervisee, including how to respond to feedback, when to seek guidance, and how to document supervision activities.

**Study tips:**

- Read the RBT Ethics Code (2.0) published by the BACB. This is the source document for this entire domain. Don't rely on summaries or third-party interpretations — read the actual code and know what each section requires.
- Practice scenario-based questions about professional boundaries. The exam loves to present situations where the "right" answer feels overly cautious. Trust the code. When in doubt, the answer is usually: maintain the boundary, consult your supervisor, and document.
- Study cultural responsiveness specifically. This is new content that many candidates overlook. Understand what cultural humility means in practice, how cultural factors can influence behavior and intervention effectiveness, and how to adapt your approach while maintaining fidelity to the behavior plan.

## What's New in the 3rd Edition: The 8 New Tasks

If you studied for the 2nd Edition or are using older study materials, these are the tasks you're most likely to miss on exam day:

1. **Token economy implementation** — setting up, running, and troubleshooting token systems as a behavior acquisition procedure
2. **Cultural awareness and responsiveness** — understanding how cultural variables affect service delivery and demonstrating cultural humility
3. **Mandatory reporting procedures** — knowing your legal obligations around suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation
4. **IOA and data verification** — implementing procedures for checking data accuracy between observers
5. **Generalization and maintenance programming** — systematically planning for skill transfer across settings, people, and materials
6. **Expanded antecedent-based interventions** — broader coverage of proactive behavior support strategies including environmental arrangement
7. **Supervision documentation** — recording supervision sessions and responding appropriately to supervisory feedback
8. **Ethics code application** — applying specific provisions of the RBT Ethics Code to practice scenarios as standalone test items

These 8 tasks represent the areas where older study materials will have the biggest gaps. If your practice tests don't include questions on token economies, cultural responsiveness, mandatory reporting, and standalone ethics scenarios, they haven't been updated for the 3rd Edition.

## How to Allocate Your Study Time

Your study hours should roughly mirror the exam's domain weights. Here's a practical framework:

| Domain | Exam Weight | Study Priority | Rationale |
|--------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Behavior Acquisition | 25% | Highest | Largest domain, includes new token economy content |
| Behavior Reduction | 20% | High | Second largest, expanded function-based emphasis |
| Measurement and Data Collection | 15% | Moderate | New IOA task requires focused preparation |
| Documentation and Reporting | 15% | Moderate | New mandatory reporting content |
| Professional Conduct and Ethics | 15% | High | Most restructured domain, all-new task structure |
| Assessment | 10% | Standard | Least changed from 2nd Edition |

One important caveat: **Ethics deserves more time than its 15% weight alone suggests.** Because this is the most significantly restructured domain and contains content that wasn't previously tested as standalone tasks, most candidates will have the biggest knowledge gaps here — regardless of clinical experience. Consider adding an extra 2–3 study sessions focused specifically on the new ethics tasks, even after your primary study cycle is complete.

The same applies to token economies in Behavior Acquisition. Experienced RBTs may use token systems every day, but the exam tests *terminology and procedural precision*, not just practical familiarity. Make sure you can describe the components and common implementation errors using the language the BACB expects.

## The Bottom Line

The RBT exam is different in 2026. Not harder — different. The 3rd Edition TCO reorganizes content, adds 8 new tasks, and elevates ethics to a directly tested domain for the first time. Candidates who understand these changes and align their preparation to the current exam structure have a significant advantage over those still working through 2nd Edition materials.

Study the domains by weight. Focus extra time on the new content areas. Practice with materials that actually reflect the current test content outline.

If you're looking for practice questions specifically aligned to the 3rd Edition TCO, I built [RBT Study at Behavior School](https://rbtstudy.behaviorschool.com) with questions mapped to all 43 tasks across all 6 domains — including the 8 new tasks that most other practice tests haven't caught up to yet.

You've got the breakdown. Now go study the right material.
