**Date:** March 7, 2026 | **Time:** 2:55 PM - 3:55 PM
**Speakers:** Rob Spain, Cristal Lopez, Megan Caluza

## **Slide 1: Title Slide**
- **Title:** Beyond Observable Behavior: Measuring and Modifying the Function of Thought in School-Based Assessment
- **Subtitle:** Integrating ACT & Functional Analysis in Public Schools
- **Presenters:** Rob Spain, BCBA; Cristal Lopez, BCaBA; Megan Caluza, BCBA
- **Affiliation:** Kings Canyon Unified School District (KCUSD) Behavior Team

## **Slide 2: The Problem**
- **Headline:** The Gap in Traditional FBA
- **Bullet Points:**
    - Traditional FBAs focus on observable antecedents/consequences.
    - Many students (K-12) exhibit severe behaviors (aggression, refusal) driven by *private events* (rigid thoughts, experiential avoidance).
    - "I'm stupid," "I can't do this," "It's too hard" → leads to escape.
    - Standard FBA misses the "function of thought."
- **Visual Idea:** Iceberg graphic. Top: Aggression/Refusal. Bottom: "I'm not good enough," "Everyone is watching me."

## **Slide 3: Our Solution**
- **Headline:** A Dual-Lens Approach
- **Core Concept:** Wrapping ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Training) within a Functional Assessment framework.
- **Key Components:**
    1.  **Latency-Based Precursor Analysis:** Identifying the *thought* before the behavior.
    2.  **ACT-Informed BIPs:** Writing "psychological flexibility" into the IEP.
    3.  **Staff Training:** Teaching paras to coach defusion, not just compliance.
    4.  **Data:** Measuring physiological flexibility (CPFQ) & academic tolerance.

## **Part 1: The Assessment Phase (Rob Spain)**
*Paper: The Clinical Application of Precursor FA: Identifying Internal Drivers of Behavior*

## **Slide 4: Moving Beyond A-B-C**
- **Headline:** Identifying Internal Drivers
- **Concept:** Transitioning from Standard FBA → ACT-Informed Assessment.
- **Method:** Latency-Based Precursor Analysis.
- **Goal:** Identify "early indicators" of cognitive inflexibility before the explosion.

## **Slide 5: The Protocol**
- **Headline:** Safe Assessment in Schools
- **Step 1:** Environmental Assessment (Standard FBA).
- **Step 2:** Clinical Measures (CPFQ - Child Psychological Flexibility Questionnaire).
- **Step 3:** The "Test" Conditions.
    - Instead of pushing to behavior, we measure the *latency* (time) to the first verbal/non-verbal sign of avoidance.
    - Example: Student puts head down, says "This is dumb" (Precursor) → Stop test.

## **Slide 6: Case Study / Data**
- **Headline:** Differentiating the Function
- **Graph:** Latency to Precursor.
- **Interpretation:** Short latency in "Rigid Rule" conditions vs. Control.
- **Takeaway:** We can scientifically demonstrate that *thought* controls the behavior, not just the task itself.

## **Part 2: The Intervention Phase (Cristal Lopez)**
*Paper: Values-Based Programming: Integrating ACT into the Standard BIP and IEP Process*

## **Slide 7: From Assessment to Action**
- **Headline:** Writing ACT into the IEP
- **Challenge:** How do we make "acceptance" measurable and legally defensible?
- **Solution:** Adapting the standard BIP template.

## **Slide 8: Values-Based Goals**
- **Headline:** Replacements > Reductions
- **Old Goal:** "Student will reduce task refusal to 0 occurrences."
- **New Goal (Values-Based):** "When feeling frustrated (antecedent), Student will use a defusion strategy (behavior) to complete 5 minutes of work (value: being a learner)."
- **Key:** Tying the behavior to *what matters* to the student.

## **Slide 9: Curricula & Strategies**
- **Headline:** Teaching the Skills
- **Tools:** Structured curricula for Defusion & Acceptance.
- **Adaptive Design:** Visuals for non-readers, metaphors for older students (e.g., "The Bus Driver," "Tug of War").
- **Clinical Example:** Show a "DNA-V" card or a specific visual used with a student.

## **Part 3: Implementation & Fidelity (Megan Caluza)**
*Paper: Systems of Support: Training and Coaching Staff in ACT-Informed Strategies*

## **Slide 10: The Human Factor**
- **Headline:** It Only Works if Staff Can Do It
- **Challenge:** Paras/Teachers are used to "command & control." ACT requires "coaching & connection."
- **Method:** Behavioral Skills Training (BST).

## **Slide 11: The Coaching Model**
- **Headline:** Teaching Staff to "Drop the Rope"
- **Instruction:** Explain the concept.
- **Modeling:** BCBA demonstrates the interaction.
- **Rehearsal:** Roleplay with staff.
- **Feedback:** Real-time coaching logs.
- **Tool:** Fidelity Checklist (Did they validate? Did they prompt the strategy? Did they reinforce values?).

## **Slide 12: Scaling It Up**
- **Headline:** Sustainability
- **Point:** Creating a system where this happens across multiple classrooms.
- **Visual:** "Train the Trainer" model or a snapshot of a fidelity log.

## **Part 4: Outcomes & Social Validity (Rob Spain)**
*Paper: Evaluating the Model: Social Validity and Aggregate Outcomes of ACT in Schools*

## **Slide 13: Does It Work?**
- **Headline:** Aggregate Outcomes
- **Data Points:**
    - **CPFQ Scores:** Increasing Psychological Flexibility.
    - **Externalizing Behavior:** Decreasing aggression/refusal.
    - **Academic Tolerance:** Increasing work completion.
- **Correlation:** As flexibility goes UP, behavior problems go DOWN.

## **Slide 14: Social Validity**
- **Headline:** Do They Like It?
- **Feedback:** Quotes from teachers, parents, and students.
- **Theme:** "He's not just behaving better; he's happier."
- **Takeaway:** ACT improves quality of life, not just compliance.

## **Slide 15: Conclusion**
- **Headline:** The Future of School-Based ABA
- **Summary:**
    1.  Assess the Thought.
    2.  Intervene with Values.
    3.  Train with Compassion.
    4.  Measure the Life Change.
- **Call to Action:** Start measuring private events. They are behavioral determinants.
