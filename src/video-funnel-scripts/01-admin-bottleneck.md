title: "Video 01: The Admin Bottleneck"
step: 1
---
**HOOK:** You’re building a movement, but your board members are stuck at the front door.

**THE PROBLEM:** Right now, we have a "Manual Bottleneck." Every single staff member who signs up is stuck in "Pending" status until an admin manually logs in to click 'Approve.' It kills momentum. In the time it takes to verify a known board member, the excitement for the new system has already faded.

**THE SOLUTION:** We are implementing "Domain Whitelisting." If someone signs up with your organization's official email domain—like @baesig.org—the system recognizes them instantly. They get auto-approved, auto-roled, and can start working immediately.

**THE OUTCOME:** Instant access for your core team, while keeping the security tight for everyone else. We’re moving from permission-based growth to momentum-based growth.
