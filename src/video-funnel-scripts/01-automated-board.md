**HOOK:** You’re building a movement, but your leadership team is stuck at the front door.

**THE PROBLEM:** Every time a new board member signs up, they are stuck in "Pending" until an existing admin manually approves them. This kills momentum. If someone picks the wrong role, like "ACE Coordinator" when they are a "Board Member," they’re currently locked out with no way to fix it but to delete the account and start over.

**THE SOLUTION:** We are implementing "Domain Whitelisting" and "Direct Re-Role." If they sign up with your official organization email, they are auto-approved. And if they make a mistake on their role, you can now toggle their permissions with one click—no deletions required.

**THE OUTCOME:** Your core team gets in instantly, stays productive, and setup friction becomes a thing of the past.
