**Rob:** Most organizations start with a vision of growth, but they immediately fall into "The Reactivity Trap." You spend your first week just trying to get your team through the front door. 

Right now, we have a manual bottleneck. Every single board member who signs up is stuck in "Pending" until someone else logs in to click 'Approve.' It kills your momentum.

**Rob:** That’s why the first step in our new onboarding is Domain Whitelisting. If your team uses your official email—like @baesig.org—they are auto-approved. We’re also adding a notification badge to the Admin button so you never have a stale request sitting in the queue for months. 

We’re moving from permission-based friction to instant access. Let’s get your core team inside so you can stop reacting and start leading.
