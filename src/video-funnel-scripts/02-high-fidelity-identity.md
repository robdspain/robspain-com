**HOOK:** A signature is a legal requirement, not a digital doodle.

**THE PROBLEM:** The "Signature Pad" disaster. Instructors drawing their signatures with a mouse on a desktop results in illegible scribbles that professional auditors will reject. Worse, as an admin, you currently approve users without even seeing if their signature is valid or corrupt.

**THE SOLUTION:** We’ve added "Typed Signature" options with professional script fonts and an "Upload Image" button. For admins, we’ve added "Signature Previews" directly to the verification cards.

**THE OUTCOME:** Clean, compliant signatures on every certificate and total visibility for admins before you ever issue a unit.
