**Rob:** There’s a common myth that every user needs a hand-held setup. But individual support doesn't scale. What scales is integrity.

We’ve all seen the "Signature Pad" disaster—instructors scribbling with a mouse, resulting in a mess that no auditor would accept. A signature is a legal requirement, not a doodle.

**[Visual: Comparison of "Scribble" vs "Professional Typed/Uploaded Signature"]**

**Rob:** We’re solving this with high-fidelity options: Typed signatures with script fallbacks and direct image uploads. Now, when you verify a user, you get a full Signature Preview right on their card. 

No more "blind approvals." You see exactly what will appear on the certificates before you issue them. Professionalism is built into the foundation, so you don't have to fix it later.
