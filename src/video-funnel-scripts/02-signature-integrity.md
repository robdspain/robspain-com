**HOOK:** A signature is more than a scribble; it’s a legal requirement for every CEU you issue.

**THE PROBLEM:** The "Signature Pad" disaster. We’ve been asking instructors to draw their signatures on a digital canvas. If they're on a desktop with a mouse, it looks like a mess. Professional auditors and the BACB won't accept "scribbles" on a formal certificate. It looks amateur and risks your compliance.

**THE SOLUTION:** We’re adding two critical options: "Typed Signatures" with a professional script font fallback, and a direct "Upload Image" button. 

**THE OUTCOME:** Your instructors can now provide a clean, high-fidelity signature that looks perfect on every PDF, whether they are on a phone, a tablet, or a desktop. Professionalism, guaranteed.
