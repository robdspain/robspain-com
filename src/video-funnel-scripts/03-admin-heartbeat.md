**HOOK:** Don't let your verification queue become a graveyard for new users.

**THE PROBLEM:** Requests can sit in the queue for months because there’s no reminder system. Unless an admin checks a specific tab, those new sign-ups are forgotten, and your platform growth stalls.

**THE SOLUTION:** We’re adding the "Admin Heartbeat." A live Notification Badge will now appear on your dashboard the moment a request is pending. It stays there until you take action.

**THE OUTCOME:** You respond in real-time, keeping your users engaged and your platform growing without the manual check-ins.
