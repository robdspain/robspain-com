step: 3

**HOOK:** If your team doesn't know their role, the system can't do its job.

**THE PROBLEM:** "Role Confusion." In our database, an "ACE Coordinator" and a "Board Member" have different permissions, but in the real world, those lines blur. If a user picks the wrong role during sign-up, they are currently locked out of the features they need, and the only fix is for an admin to delete their entire account and start over.

**THE SOLUTION:** We are empowering admins with a "Re-Role" feature. Directly from the User Verification screen, you can toggle a user’s permissions with one click. 

**THE OUTCOME:** No more deleted accounts. No more setup friction. Just a flexible system that adapts to your team's real-world structure.
