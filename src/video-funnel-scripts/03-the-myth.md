**[Scene: Rob on camera, conversational tone]**

There's a belief that most school BCBAs carry around like a badge of honor. And it's absolutely destroying them.

It's the belief that says: **"If I just work harder, I can help more kids."**

Sound familiar?

We're trained to believe that our value comes from direct service. More assessments. More behavior plans. More one-on-one interventions. More hours.

So when things aren't working, what do we do? We work harder. We stay later. We bring work home. We sacrifice our weekends, our health, our relationships—all in the name of helping kids.

**[Shaking head]**

But here's the brutal truth I had to learn: **Working harder in a broken system just breaks *you* faster.**

Think about it. If you have 40 students on your caseload and you're trying to individually support each one, you're fighting a losing battle. There literally aren't enough hours in the day.

And worse—while you're running around putting out fires, you're not building the infrastructure that would *prevent* those fires in the first place.

**[Leaning forward]**

I call this the "Individual Support Myth." It's the idea that the best way to help students is through direct, one-on-one intervention.

Now, don't get me wrong—individual support matters. Some students absolutely need intensive, individualized intervention.

But here's what nobody taught me in grad school: **For every hour you spend in direct service, you lose an hour you could spend training staff, building systems, and creating sustainable change.**

The math doesn't work. It never will.

**[More energized]**

The BCBAs who don't burn out—the ones who actually create lasting impact and love their jobs—they figured out something different.

They stopped trying to be everywhere at once. They started building systems that work *without* them in the room.

In the next video, I'll share the exact moment I discovered this for myself—and the framework that completely transformed how I work.

I'll see you there.
