**Rob:** At the university level, we learn that systems must be flexible to survive. But in most software, roles are a maze. 

Currently, if an ACE Coordinator accidentally signs up as a Board Member, they’re trapped. You’d have to delete their account and start over. That’s not a system; that’s a cage.

**[Visual: Admin screen showing "Re-Role" toggle]**

**Rob:** We’re introducing "Re-Role" capabilities. Admins can now shift permissions with a single click from the verification screen. It’s a university-validated approach: define the person first, and let the system adapt to their changing responsibilities.

By removing the role maze, we ensure your team can actually do the work they were hired to do.
