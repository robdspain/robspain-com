**HOOK:** Approving a user shouldn't be a guessing game.

**THE PROBLEM:** The "Blind Approval." Currently, when an admin approves a user, they see a name and an email. But they can’t see the signature that user provided. You don’t find out the signature is missing or corrupted until you’re actually trying to issue a certificate—and by then, it’s too late.

**THE SOLUTION:** We’re adding "Signature Previews" and "Pending Reminders." Now, when you look at a verification card, you see the signature right there. Plus, a new "Notification Badge" on your Admin Dashboard will let you know exactly how many requests are waiting for your attention.

**THE OUTCOME:** Total visibility. You catch errors before they become compliance headaches, and no request ever sits in the queue for months again.
