**HOOK:** When an auditor calls, the last thing you need is a spreadsheet of broken links.

**THE PROBLEM:** Most audit bundles only give you data, not files. You end up manually searching Google Drive for individual CVs and Syllabi. If you try to fetch years of data at once, the browser crashes.

**THE SOLUTION:** We are launching the "Cloud-to-ZIP" service with Paginated Generation. You select the year, and the system automatically packages every mandatory PDF into one organized ZIP file, handling thousands of records without slowing down.

**THE OUTCOME:** You go from days of manual hunting to one click and 60 seconds. The audit panic is gone.
