**[Scene: Rob on camera, storytelling energy]**

So there I was—burned out, overwhelmed, ready to quit. But that conversation with my wife planted a seed.

What if I was approaching this all wrong?

I started paying attention to something I'd never noticed before. In every district I'd worked in, there were always one or two BCBAs who seemed... different. They had the same caseloads, the same impossible expectations—but they weren't drowning.

They left work on time. They didn't seem constantly stressed. And somehow, their students were making *more* progress than mine.

**[Curious tone]**

So I did something uncomfortable. I asked one of them to lunch. Her name was Maria, and she'd been a school BCBA for fifteen years.

I basically said, "How are you not burned out? What am I missing?"

And she laughed. She said, "Rob, you're trying to be the intervention. You need to become the architect."

**[Pause for impact]**

The architect.

She explained that early in her career, she'd made the same mistake I was making. She tried to personally support every student, implement every plan, solve every crisis.

But then she realized: **Her job wasn't to be the solution. Her job was to build systems that created solutions.**

**[Getting excited]**

Instead of writing behavior plans and hoping teachers would follow them, she trained teachers to understand behavior principles. Instead of responding to every crisis, she built Tier 1 supports that dramatically reduced the number of crises happening.

Instead of being the bottleneck, she became the multiplier.

That lunch changed my entire career. I went back to my district and started looking at everything differently.

Where was I being reactive when I could be proactive?
Where was I doing things manually that could be systematized?
Where was I hoarding expertise that I could be teaching?

**[Leaning in]**

It took me a while to figure it out—lots of trial and error—but eventually, I developed what I now call the 5-Pillar Framework for Systems Leadership.

And in the next video, I'm going to walk you through exactly what those five pillars are.

See you there.
