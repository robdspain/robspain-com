title: "Video 05: The Audit Panic"
step: 5
---
**HOOK:** When the BACB calls for an audit, "links in a spreadsheet" aren't going to cut it.

**THE PROBLEM:** The "Incomplete Bundle." Right now, our audit portal gathers data, but it doesn't gather the actual files. An auditor wants the Syllabus, the CVs, and the sign-in sheets in one place. Sending them a list of Google Drive links is a recipe for a failed audit and a very stressed board.

**THE SOLUTION:** We are launching a "Cloud-to-ZIP" service. You select the year, click "Generate Bundle," and the system automatically reaches into your Drive, grabs every required PDF, and packages them into a single, organized ZIP file.

**THE OUTCOME:** You go from a week of manual searching to a 60-second download. The panic is gone.
