**HOOK:** Your ACE provider status is built on the integrity of your records.

**THE PROBLEM:** If you fix a typo on a certificate, there’s currently no record of why it happened. BACB standards require a reason for every manual change. Plus, if a file is moved or deleted on Drive, your audit portal is broken, and you won't know until it’s too late.

**THE SOLUTION:** We’re implementing "Correction Logs" and a "Dead Link Scanner." Every edit now requires a reason, and the scanner automatically alerts you if a required document goes missing.

**THE OUTCOME:** A self-healing, transparent registry that proves your compliance to any auditor, every time.
