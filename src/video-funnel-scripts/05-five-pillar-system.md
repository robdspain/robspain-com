**Rob:** Most people see a school in chaos and try to fix everything at once. That’s a recipe for burnout. You need a map. I call it the Behavior School Framework.

**[Visual: Graphic showing the 5 Pillars: 1. Audit, 2. Design, 3. Train, 4. Implement, 5. Refine]**

**Rob:** 
1. **Audit** the current chaos to see where the leaks are.
2. **Design** the Tier 1 safety net that catches 80% of behaviors.
3. **Train** the staff using micro-learning (no more boring PDs).
4. **Implement** with micro-coaching in the classroom.
5. **Data-driven refinement** to make it stick.

This is how you stop being a fire-fighter and start being a systems leader.
