**[Scene: Rob on camera, teaching mode with enthusiasm]**

Alright, let me share the framework that completely transformed my career—and has helped hundreds of other school BCBAs escape the burnout trap.

I call it the **5-Pillar Framework for Systems Leadership.**

**[Visual: Pillar 1]**

**Pillar One: Prevention Over Reaction**

This is the foundation. Most BCBAs spend 80% of their time in crisis mode. But every crisis is a symptom of a missing system.

When you shift your focus to Tier 1 and Tier 2 supports—school-wide behavior frameworks, classroom management systems, early intervention protocols—you prevent the crises before they happen.

**Pillar Two: Train the Trainers**

You cannot personally support every student. But you *can* train the people who interact with those students every day.

This means building teacher capacity, coaching paras, educating admin. When your staff understands behavior principles, they become extensions of your expertise.

**Pillar Three: Systematize Everything**

If you do something more than twice, create a system for it. Data collection templates. Intervention decision trees. Meeting protocols. Documentation workflows.

Systems create consistency. Consistency creates results.

**Pillar Four: Strategic Communication**

The best behavior plan in the world is worthless if admin doesn't support it, teachers don't buy in, and parents don't understand it.

This pillar is about translating behavior analysis into language everyone understands, building relationships, and creating allies throughout the system.

**Pillar Five: Sustainable Boundaries**

Here's the one nobody talks about. You cannot pour from an empty cup. Systems Leadership includes building systems that protect *your* time, *your* energy, and *your* wellbeing.

This means learning to say no, setting realistic expectations, and creating workflows that don't require your constant presence.

**[Back to Rob, summarizing]**

When you build on all five pillars, something magical happens. You stop being the bottleneck. You start being the architect.

Your impact multiplies because you're working *through* systems instead of against them.

**[Warm tone]**

In the next video, I want to paint you a picture of what this actually looks like in practice—what your life could look like as a Systems Leader.

I'll see you there.
