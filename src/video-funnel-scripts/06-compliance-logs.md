**HOOK:** Accuracy is the foundation of your ACE provider status.

**THE PROBLEM:** Missing "Reasons for Change." If an admin fixes a typo on a certificate, we currently just overwrite the data. But BACB standards require a log of *why* a record was changed. Without that log, you lack a transparent audit trail.

**THE SOLUTION:** We’re implementing a "Correction Log" and a "Dead Link Scanner." Every manual edit will now require a brief reason, saved forever. Meanwhile, the Link Scanner will automatically alert you if a mandatory document has been moved or deleted from your Drive.

**THE OUTCOME:** A self-healing, transparent registry that proves your integrity to any auditor, every time.
