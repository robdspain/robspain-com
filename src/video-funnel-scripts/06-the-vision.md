**[Scene: Rob on camera, painting a vision]**

Close your eyes for a second. I want you to imagine something.

It's 4:30 on a Friday afternoon. You're packing up your bag to leave work—on time. Not because you're cutting corners, but because your week's work is actually done.

Your behavior plans are being implemented. Not perfectly, but consistently—because you trained your teachers and gave them the tools they need.

Your crisis calls have dropped by 60%. Not because you're ignoring problems, but because your Tier 1 systems are catching issues before they escalate.

**[Warming up]**

When you *do* get called to a classroom, it's for consultation—not crisis management. Teachers want your input, not your rescue.

Your admin sees you as a strategic partner. They invite you to leadership meetings. They actually listen when you advocate for resources.

You have time—actual time—to do deep work on the cases that really need individualized support. The complex kids who deserve your full attention? They finally get it.

**[Personal note]**

And here's the part that surprised me most: You actually *like* your job again.

You feel competent. You feel impactful. You go home with energy left for your family, your hobbies, your life outside of work.

**[Direct to camera]**

This isn't a fantasy. This is what's possible when you stop trying to be everything to everyone and start building systems that do the heavy lifting.

I've lived it. I've seen hundreds of BCBAs make this shift. And I want to help you do the same.

**[Transitional]**

But I know what you might be thinking. "That sounds great, Rob, but I don't have time to build systems. I'm barely keeping my head above water."

That's the trap. And in the next video, I'm going to address it head-on—because I know exactly why you feel stuck, and I know it's not your fault.

See you there.
