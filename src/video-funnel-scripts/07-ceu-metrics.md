**HOOK:** You can’t report on what you can’t see.

**THE PROBLEM:** The "Compliance Gap." When it’s time for your annual provider report, do you know exactly how many Ethics vs. Supervision units you issued? Currently, that data is buried in individual records. Calculating it manually is a nightmare.

**THE SOLUTION:** We’re adding a "CEU Breakdown Chart" directly to your portal. One glance shows you your global impact across all categories. Plus, we’re implementing "Paginated Generation" so the portal stays fast even as your registry grows to thousands of users.

**THE OUTCOME:** Instant metrics for your reports and a system that never slows down, no matter how big you get.
