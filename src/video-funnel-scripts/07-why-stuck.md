**[Scene: Rob on camera, empathetic but direct]**

If you've made it this far, you probably believe me that Systems Leadership is possible. You can see the vision. You *want* to make the shift.

But something's holding you back. Let me guess what it might be.

**[Addressing objection 1]**

**"I don't have time."**

I hear this one constantly. And I get it—I really do. When you're drowning, the last thing you want to hear is "build systems." It feels like someone telling you to learn to swim while you're struggling to keep your head above water.

But here's the thing: You don't have time *because* you don't have systems.

Every minute you invest in building a system pays dividends forever. That teacher training you keep putting off? It could eliminate 10 crisis calls a month. That documentation template you haven't created? It could save you 3 hours a week.

The choice isn't between fighting fires and building systems. It's between fighting fires forever or investing a little time now to prevent them.

**[Addressing objection 2]**

**"My district won't support it."**

Maybe. Some districts are genuinely resistant to change. But in my experience, most admin aren't against systems—they just don't understand behavior analysis.

When you learn to communicate strategically, to translate ABA into language admin understands, to build relationships with decision-makers... doors open. I've seen it happen in the most resistant districts imaginable.

**[Addressing objection 3]**

**"I don't know how."**

This one's real. Nobody taught us this stuff in grad school. We learned how to do FBAs and write behavior plans. We didn't learn how to lead systems, train staff, or navigate school politics.

That's not your fault. But it also doesn't have to stay that way.

**[Softer tone]**

Look, I'm not here to minimize what you're facing. Being a school BCBA is genuinely hard. The expectations are unrealistic. The support is often nonexistent.

But I've seen too many talented professionals burn out and leave this field. And I've also seen what happens when someone makes the shift to Systems Leadership.

**[Leaning in]**

In the next video, I want to share some real results—what's actually possible when you make this transformation.

See you there.
