**Rob:** I want you to meet Sarah. She was a School BCBA in a high-needs district, and by November, she was ready to quit. She was the classic "Crisis Manager."

**Rob:** We implemented the 5-Pillar System together. By February, her crisis calls dropped from fifteen a day to just two. She wasn't running anymore; she was leading. She finally felt like the expert she was trained to be. 

Sarah’s story isn't a fluke—it’s the natural result of moving from clinical intervention to systematic leadership.
