**[Scene: Rob on camera, sharing what the transformation looks like]**

Let me tell you what I've seen happen when school BCBAs make this shift.

**[Composite Example — clearly framed as such]**

*Note: These are composite examples based on common patterns I've seen across school BCBAs I've worked with. They don't represent specific individuals.*

Imagine a BCBA with a caseload of 50+ students across multiple schools. Working 60-hour weeks. Seriously considering leaving the field.

When someone like that implements a Systems Leadership framework — building Tier 2 supports, training general ed teachers to handle common behavior concerns, creating consultation models instead of being the sole responder — the shift is dramatic.

Crisis calls drop significantly. Caseloads get restructured because admin can finally see data on what's working. The BCBA starts leaving at a reasonable hour — and their students are making *better* progress, because there's finally time to focus on the cases that truly need specialized expertise.

Or think about the veteran BCBA — 10, 12 years in — completely burned out. They've tried time management apps, self-care routines, all the individual solutions. What actually works? Shifting from crisis manager to systems leader. It's a fundamentally different job — one they can sustain.

**[Direct to camera]**

These aren't hypothetical. These are patterns I've seen repeat across districts, across states.

When you stop trying to be everything to everyone — when you start building systems instead of being the system — everything changes.

**[Transition]**

Now, I know what you might be wondering: "How do I actually make this shift? Where do I even start?"

That's exactly why I created the 8-Week Transformation Program. And in the next video, I'm going to tell you all about it.

See you there.
