**[Scene: Rob on camera, sharing testimonials/results]**

Let me tell you about some real people who've made this transformation.

**[Story 1]**

Sarah was a BCBA in Texas with a caseload of 52 students across 8 schools. She was working 60-hour weeks and seriously considering leaving the field.

Within 8 weeks of implementing the Systems Leadership framework, she reduced her crisis calls by 65%. She got her caseload restructured. She started leaving work by 5 PM most days.

More importantly? Her students were making *better* progress than before. Because she finally had time to focus on the cases that truly needed her expertise.

**[Story 2]**

Marcus was the only BCBA in a rural district of 4,000 students. He felt completely alone and overwhelmed.

He built a Tier 2 intervention system that trained general ed teachers to handle most behavior concerns themselves. He created a consultation model that multiplied his impact. Now he mentors two new BCBAs his district was able to hire because admin finally saw the value of behavior support.

**[Story 3]**

Jennifer had been a school BCBA for 12 years and was completely burned out. She'd tried everything—time management apps, self-care routines, even therapy.

What finally worked? Shifting from crisis manager to systems leader. She says it's like she's doing a completely different job now—one she actually loves again.

These aren't outliers. I've seen this transformation happen over and over again.

When you stop trying to be everything to everyone—when you start building systems instead of being the system—everything changes.

**[Transition]**

Now, I know what you might be wondering: "How do I actually make this shift? Where do I even start?"

That's exactly why I created the 8-Week Transformation Program. And in the next video, I'm going to tell you all about it.

See you there.
