**HOOK:** Imagine getting an audit notice and feeling... nothing. No panic, no late nights, just confidence.

**THE PROBLEM:** Meet Sarah. She ran a successful ACE program but dreaded the annual reporting. When she finally got the audit call, she spent three days straight hunting down missing CVs and re-issuing certificates with corrected dates.

**THE SOLUTION:** Sarah switched to our 5-Pillar System. Six months later, another audit request came in. Instead of a three-day panic, she clicked "Generate Audit Bundle" and had a complete, compliant ZIP file ready in 60 seconds.

**THE OUTCOME:** Sarah passed her audit with zero corrections. She went from being a "Paperwork Chaser" to a "Systems Leader," and you can too.
