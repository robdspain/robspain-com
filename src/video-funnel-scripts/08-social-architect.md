**HOOK:** Stop sounding like a robot and start sounding like a leader.

**THE PROBLEM:** "Repetitive AI." Most AI marketing tools generate generic, corporate speak that people just scroll past. Without a defined "Brand Voice," your social media feels disconnected from your actual mission.

**THE SOLUTION:** The "Brand Persona Wizard." The first time you use our marketing tools, we help you define your unique voice. Plus, we’ve added a "Context Warning"—the AI will now tell you if you’re trying to market an event before you’ve uploaded the syllabus, preventing "hallucinated" content.

**THE OUTCOME:** Social posts that actually sound like you, backed by the accurate data of your courses.
