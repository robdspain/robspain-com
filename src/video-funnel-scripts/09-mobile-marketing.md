**HOOK:** Your marketing happens on a desktop, but your audience is on their phones.

**THE PROBLEM:** The "Format Gap." We generate marketing assets on desktops, but Instagram and LinkedIn live on our phones. Saving an image, emailing it to yourself, and then downloading it to post is a friction point that stops you from being consistent.

**THE SOLUTION:** "Scan-to-Phone" QR Codes and Aspect Ratio Toggles. Now, you can generate the perfect 1.91:1 LinkedIn image or 9:16 Story, scan a code with your phone, and have the image and caption ready to post instantly.

**THE OUTCOME:** Seamless, cross-platform marketing that takes seconds, not half an hour.
