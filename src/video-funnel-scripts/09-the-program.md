**[Scene: Rob on camera, presenting the offer]**

For years, people have asked me: "Rob, how can I learn to do what you do? How can I make this shift from crisis manager to systems leader?"

I've done workshops. I've done conference presentations. But I kept seeing the same problem: People would get inspired, go back to their districts... and nothing would change.

Because real transformation doesn't happen in a one-hour webinar. It happens through sustained support, accountability, and implementation.

That's why I created the **8-Week Transformation Program.**

**[What it is]**

This is an intensive coaching program designed specifically for school-based BCBAs who are ready to stop surviving and start leading.

Over 8 weeks, I'll guide you through the complete Systems Leadership framework—not just the theory, but the actual implementation.

**[What's included]**

**Weekly Group Coaching Calls**

Every week, we meet live. I teach a new module, answer your questions, and help you troubleshoot real challenges in your district. You're not doing this alone.

**Done-For-You Templates & Tools**

I'm giving you everything I've built over 20+ years. Data collection systems. Training materials. Meeting protocols. Communication templates. Documentation workflows.

These aren't generic resources—they're the exact tools I use and have refined over hundreds of implementations.

**[How it works]**

Week by week, we build your Systems Leadership foundation:

- Weeks 1-2: Audit your current situation and identify your biggest leverage points
- Weeks 3-4: Build your Tier 1 and Tier 2 prevention systems
- Weeks 5-6: Develop your staff training and communication strategies
- Weeks 7-8: Create sustainable boundaries and long-term maintenance plans

By the end, you'll have a complete transformation blueprint customized to your specific district.

**[Direct to camera]**

This is the program I wish existed when I was burning out. It's the clinical, systematic support that would have saved me years of struggle.

In the final video, I'm going to share how you can join us. I'll see you there.
