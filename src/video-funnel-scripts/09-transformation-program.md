**[Scene: Rob sitting comfortably, inviting tone]**

**Rob:** This is why I created the 8-Week Transformation Program. I wanted to take you from overwhelmed to a Systems Leader, step-by-step.

**Rob:** You get the complete framework, weekly group coaching sessions with me, and lifetime access to every automation tool I’ve ever built. It’s the clinical and systematic support I wish I had twenty years ago when I was starting out. 

If you're ready to stop fire-fighting and start leading, this is your invitation.
