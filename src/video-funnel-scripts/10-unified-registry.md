**HOOK:** Your contacts are more than just a list of emails; they are a history of learning.

**THE PROBLEM:** "Disconnected Data." Most CRMs show you a name, but they don't show you that person's certificate history. You're constantly jumping between tabs to see if a contact is a "2024 Attendee" or a new lead.

**THE SOLUTION:** We are launching the "Learner Profile" slide-over and "Upsert" logic. One view shows you everything: contact info, tags, and every CEU they’ve ever earned. Plus, our new "CRM Heartbeat" automatically updates their 'Last Active' status whenever they interact with your site.

**THE OUTCOME:** A single source of truth. Bulk tag 50 people, send an update, and manage your community with total confidence.
