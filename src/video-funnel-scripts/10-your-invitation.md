**[Scene: Rob on camera, warm and direct]**

You've watched all these videos. You know the problem. You've seen the solution. You've heard the results.

If this resonates and you want support making the shift to Systems Leadership, I’d love to help.

**[The invitation]**

Here’s the next step if you want to explore the program:

**[behaviorschool.com/transformation-program](https://behaviorschool.com/transformation-program)**

On that page, you’ll find the full details—what’s included, who it’s designed for, and how it works.

**[Addressing hesitation]**

I know making an investment in yourself can feel scary, especially when you’re already overwhelmed.

If now isn’t the right time, that’s okay. You can still take what you’ve learned here and start small—one system, one shift, one boundary at a time.

And if you’re ready for more structured support, the program is here.

**[Closing]**

I’ve been where you are. I know how hard it is. And I know what’s possible on the other side.

If you want help getting there, I’d be honored to work with you.

Take care of yourself. And I’ll talk to you soon.
