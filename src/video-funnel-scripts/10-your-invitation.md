**[Scene: Rob on camera, warm and direct]**

You've watched all these videos. You know the problem. You've seen the solution. You've heard the results.

Now it's decision time.

**[The choice]**

You have two paths in front of you.

Path one: Go back to your district on Monday and keep doing what you've been doing. Keep fighting fires. Keep working 60-hour weeks. Keep hoping things will somehow get better on their own.

Maybe they will. But if the last few years haven't gotten easier, what's going to change?

Path two: Join me in the 8-Week Transformation Program. Get the framework, the tools, and the support to actually make the shift from crisis manager to systems leader.

**[The invitation]**

If you're ready for path two, here's what to do:

On that page, you'll find all the details—what's included, what past participants have said, and how to secure your spot.

**[Addressing hesitation]**

I know making an investment in yourself can feel scary. Especially when you're already overwhelmed.

But think about the cost of *not* doing this. The burnout. The missed time with family. The talented BCBAs who leave the field because they never learned another way.

You got into this profession because you wanted to help kids. Systems Leadership is how you actually do that—sustainably, effectively, and without destroying yourself in the process.

**[Closing]**

I've been where you are. I know how hard it is. And I know what's possible on the other side.

If you're ready to stop surviving and start leading, I'd love to help you get there.

Click the link. Check out the program. And if it feels right, apply.

I hope to see you inside.

**[Warm smile]**

Take care of yourself. And I'll talk to you soon.
